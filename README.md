# Air Quality Index (AQI) Prediction Project

## Description
This project predicts the Air Quality Index (AQI) for different cities using machine learning techniques. It provides insights into air pollution levels and helps in environmental monitoring and decision-making.

## Features
- Predicts AQI based on environmental data such as PM2.5, PM10, CO, NO2 levels.
- Visualizes AQI trends over time for better understanding.
- Provides alerts for high pollution levels.
- Interactive and easy-to-use interface for data input and visualization.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project contains historical air quality data including pollutants, weather conditions, and AQI readings.  
- Source: [UCI Machine Learning Repository]([https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/index.php](https://huggingface.co/datasets/abhinavsarkar/delhi_air_quality_feature_store_unprocessed.csv))  
- Format: CSV / Excel files

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <your-repo-link>
2.Navigate to the project folder:
   cd AQI-Prediction-Project
3.Install required libraries:
  pip install -r requirements.txt
4.Run the project:
 python main.py

##Usage

Input the city and date to get AQI predictions.
Visualizations and trend graphs are generated automatically.
Can be extended to multiple cities or updated with real-time data.
